What is the Java Persistence API? 
----------------------------------------
The Java Persistence API which provides a specification for persisting, reading, managing 
data from your Java object to relational tables in the database.

What is Hibernate Framework?
------------------------------------------
Hibernate is an Object/Relational Mapping solution for Java environments. Object-relational 
mapping or ORM is the programming technique to map application domain model objects to the 
relational database tables. Hibernate is a java based ORM tool that provides a framework for 
mapping application domain objects to the relational database tables and vice versa.

Hibernate provides a reference implementation of Java Persistence API, that makes it a great 
choice as an ORM tool with benefits of loose coupling.


What is the Difference Between JPA and Hibernate?
-------------------------------------------------------
As we know that JPA is just a specification, meaning there is no implementation. You can annotate
your classes as much as you would like with JPA annotations, however, without an implementation, 
nothing will happen. Think of JPA as the guidelines that must be followed or an interface, while Hibernate's 
JPA implementation is code that meets the API as defined by the JPA specification and provides the under the hood functionality.

In short, JPA is the interface while Hibernate is the implementation.

Traditionally there have been multiple Java ORM solutions:

Hibernate
TopLink
JDO
Eclipse Link
