
@Entity and @Table

@Entity(name = "someThing")
@Table(name = "someThing")
and I can have different names as well for same class

 @Entity(name = "someThing")
 @Table(name = "otherThing")
can anybody tell me what is the difference between these two and why we have same attribute in both ?


@Entity is deprecated now.

While Hibernate's \@Entity (i.e. org.hibernate.annotations.Entity) is deprecated, 
JPA's \@Entity (i.e. javax.persistence.Entity) is alive and well. â€“ 


@Entity(name = "someThing") => this name will be used to name the Entity
@Table(name = "someThing")  => this name will be used to name a table in DB
So, in the first case your table and entity will have the same name, that will allow you to access 
your table with the same name as the entity while writing HQL or JPQL.

And in second case while writing queries you have to use the name given in @Entity and the name given in @Table will be used to name the table in the DB.

So in HQL your someThing will refer to otherThing in the DB.
