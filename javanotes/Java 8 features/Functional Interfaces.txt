Functional Interfaces In Java
=====================================
A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. 
From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance 
of a functional interface. 

A functional interface can have any number of default methods. 

Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces.

A functional interface has only one abstract method but it can have multiple default methods.
@FunctionalInterface annotation is used to ensure an interface can’t have more than one abstract method. The use of this annotation is optional.
The java.util.function package contains many builtin functional interfaces in Java 8.

Java 8 onwards, we can assign lambda expression to its functional interface object like this:

// Java program to demonstrate Implementation of 
// functional interface using lambda expressions 
  
class Test 
{ 
  public static void main(String args[]) 
  { 
  
    // lambda expression to create the object 
    new Thread(()-> 
       {System.out.println("New thread created");}).start(); 
  } 
} 
New thread created

@FunctionalInterface Annotation
@FunctionalInterface annotation is used to ensure that the functional interface can’t 
have more than one abstract method. In case more than one abstract methods are present,
 the compiler flags an ‘Unexpected @FunctionalInterface annotation’ message. However, it is not mandatory to use this annotation.

// Java program to demonstrate lamda expressions to implement 
// a user defined functional interface. 
  
@FunctionalInterface
interface Square 
{ 
    int calculate(int x); 
} 
  
class Test 
{ 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        int a = 5; 
  
        // lambda expression to define the calculate method 
        Square s = (int x)->x*x; 
  
        // parameter passed and return type must be 
        // same as defined in the prototype 
        int ans = s.calculate(a); 
        System.out.println(ans); 
    } 
} 
Output:
25

java.util.function Package:
The java.util.function package in Java 8 contains many builtin functional interfaces like-

Predicate: The Predicate interface has an abstract method test which gives a Boolean value as a result for the specified argument. Its prototype is
public interface Predicate
{
   public boolean test(T  t);
 }
 
BinaryOperator: The BinaryOperator interface has an abstract method apply which takes two argument and returns a result of same type. Its prototype is
public interface BinaryOperator 
{
     public T apply(T x, T y);
}    
   
Function: The Function interface has an abstract method apply which takes argument of type T and returns a result of type R. Its prototype is
public interface Function 
{
   public R apply(T t);
}

// A simple program to demonstrate the use 
// of predicate interface 
import java.util.*; 
import java.util.function.Predicate; 
  
class Test 
{ 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
  
        // create a list of strings 
        List<String> names = 
            Arrays.asList("Geek","GeeksQuiz","g1","QA","Geek2"); 
  
        // declare the predicate type as string and use 
        // lambda expression to create object 
        Predicate<String> p = (s)->s.startsWith("G"); 
  
        // Iterate through the list 
        for (String st:names) 
        { 
            // call the test method 
            if (p.test(st)) 
                System.out.println(st); 
        } 
    } 
}
Output:

Geek
GeeksQuiz
Geek2
