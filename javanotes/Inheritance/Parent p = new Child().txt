Java, Child c = new parent(); gives compile time error? java inheritance polymorphism oops.
Child c = new Child(); Object 'c' has access to child's properties as well as its parent class properties. 
Hence accessing c.name and c.age was possible. By using child reference we can call both parent and 
child class (state)Fields and (behavior)methods. And when you assign like this: Parent p = new Child(); 
It is called as up-casting.

Difference between Parent p = new Child(); and Child c = new Child , At runtime there is no difference. 
There is a difference only for the Java compiler (​and type checker). In the first case you are declaring 
that the  new Child() becomes new Nephew() The second effect is a consequence of the fact that, if the 
code compiles and c is declared as a Parent , this implies that you are not using any feature which is 
not already declared in Parent , so every other class which extends from Parent is a valid substitute .

Child c = new parent(); gives compile time error?, In Java, methods are virtual by default (See this for details). 
A Java program to demonstrate that non-method Note that doing "Parent par = new Child()". A child inherits its 
characteristics from its parents but it doesn’t work the other around. Also, similar to the parent-child relationship 
of living beings, a child can have its own properties too in addition to inherited ones. In the programming context, 
the class that derives from other classes is known as derived or sub or child class
