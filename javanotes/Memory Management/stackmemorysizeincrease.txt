How to Increase the Stack Memory Size in Eclipse
If you are using Eclipse for Java programming, there are two ways to set an increased stack
memory size by passing '-Xss256M' (or any other size you want) argument to Java. One is to set
it at the time of starting Eclipse, and the other is to set it after starting Eclipse.
1. [When starting Eclipse]
You can start Eclipse with an increased stack memory size. For that you need to start Eclipse
from console or command prompt.
Steps:
1) Open your command prompt or console.
2) Change the directory to where Eclipse is installed. You should be able to see eclipse or
eclipse.exe file.
3) Run the following command to start Eclipse with the stack size 256MB.
eclipse -vmargs -Xss256M

As', 'Run Configurations'.
