Java Example: Arranging Strings in an Alphabetical Order
In this program, we are asking user to enter the count of strings that he would like to enter for sorting. 
Once the count is captured using Scanner class, we have initialized a String array of the input count 
size and then are running a for loop to capture all the strings input by user.

Once we have all the strings stored in the string array, we are comparing the first alphabet of 
each string to get them sorted in the alphabetical order.

import java.util.Scanner;
public class JavaExample
{
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    {
        int count;
        String temp;
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        //User will be asked to enter the count of strings 
        System.out.print("Enter number of strings you would like to enter:");
        count = scan.nextInt();
        
        
        String str[] = new String[count];
        Scanner scan2 = new Scanner(System.in);
        
        //User is entering the strings and they are stored in an array
        System.out.println("Enter the Strings one by one:");
        for(int i = 0; i < count; i++)
        {
            str[i] = scan2.nextLine();
        }
        scan.close();
        scan2.close();
        
        //Sorting the strings
        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) 
        {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < count; j++) { 
                if (str[i].compareTo(str[j])>0) 
                {
                    temp = str[i];
                    str[i] = str[j];
                    str[j] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        
        //Displaying the strings after sorting them based on alphabetical order
        System.out.print("Strings in Sorted Order:");
        for (int i = 0; i <= count - 1; i++) 
        {
            System.out.print(str[i] + ", ");
        }
    }
