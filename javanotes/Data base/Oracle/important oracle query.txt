SQL Query:
------------

a. to find duplicates records:
==============================================

SELECT *
FROM fruits
WHERE (fruit_name, color) IN
    (SELECT fruit_name,
        color
    FROM fruits
    GROUP BY fruit_name,
        color
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    )
ORDER BY fruit_name, color;


b. to delete duplicates record:
===============================================

DELETE FROM
  fruits
WHERE
  fruit_id NOT IN
  (
    SELECT
      MAX(fruit_id)
    FROM
      fruits
    GROUP BY
      fruit_name,
      color
  );

c. Highest Salary in each department
===================================================
  
The following query will omit duplicate values

SELECT DEPTNO, MAX(SAL) FROM EMP GROUP BY DEPTNO;

but if we want print name then

This questions become more interesting if Interviewer will ask you to print department name instead of department id, 
in that case you need to join Employee table with Department using foreign key DeptID, make sure you do LEFT or 
RIGHT OUTER JOIN to include departments without any employee as well.  Here is the query

SQL Query:

SELECT DeptName, MAX(Salary) FROM Employee e RIGHT JOIN Department d ON e.DeptId = d.DeptID GROUP BY DeptName;

d. what is the query to find 10th highest salary from employee table?
===========================================================================

approach 1-
 select name ,salary from employee e1 where 10-1 = (select count(distinct salary) from employee e2 where e2.salary > e1.salary);\
 Generallize query : select name ,salary from employee e1 where N-1 = (select count(distinct salary) from employee e2 where e2.salary > e1.salary);
                     Note : where n is number of Nth highest salary.

approach 2-					 
2nd highest salary in Oracle using ROW_NUMBER

Here is the SQL query to find the second highest salary in Oracle using row_number() function:
select * from (
select e.*, row_number() over (order by salary desc) as row_num from Employee e
) where row_num = 2;

Output:
NAME    SALARY  ROW_NUM
Mr. B    5000     2

The problem with this approach is that if you have duplicate rows (salaries) then 2nd and 3rd maximum both will be same.

approach 3-	
2nd maximum salary in Oracle using RANK
select * from (
select e.*, rank() over (order by salary desc) as rank from Employee e
) where rank = 2;

e. - Write an SQL query
===============================
  
Given below is the employee table with salary

EMPID    SALARY
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ 

101        10000
102        20000
103        1400
...
...
OUTPUT:

EMPID    RANK[Based on Salary]
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ 

102        1
101        2
103        3
...
...
[HINT] : RANK OF AN EMPLOYE CAN BE DETERMINED BY THE COUNT OF EMPLOYESS HAVING SALARY GREATER THAN EMPLOYEE

Ans-
select e.*, rank() over (order by salary desc) as rank from Employee e


f. how to get second highest salary department wise without using analytical functions?
========================================================================================

select t.deptno, max(t.salary) as maxs
from table t
where t.salary < (select max(salary)
                  from table t2
                  where t2.deptno = t.deptno
                 )
group by t.deptno;
You can then use this to get the employee:

select t.*
from table t join
     (select t.deptno, max(t.salary) as maxs
      from table t
      where t.salary < (select max(salary)
                        from table t2
                        where t2.deptno = t.deptno
                       )
      group by t.deptno
     ) tt
     on t.deptno = tt.deptno and t.salary = tt.maxs;
