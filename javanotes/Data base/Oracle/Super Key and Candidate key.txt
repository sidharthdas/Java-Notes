Super Key
---------------
It is an attribute (or a set of attributes) that uniquely identify a tuple i.e. an entity in entity set.

It is a superset of Candidate Key, since Candidate Keys are selected from super key.

Example
Let us see an example −

<Student>

Student_ID   Student_Enroll  Student_Name  Student_Email
S02				4545			Dave		ddd@gmail.com
S34				4541			Jack		jjj@gmail.com
S22				4555			Mark		mmm@gmail.com

The following are the super keys for the above table −

{Student_ID}
{Student_Enroll}
{Student_Email}
{Student_ID, Student_Enroll}
{Studet_ID, Student_Name}
{Student_ID, Student_Email}
{Student_Name, Student_Enroll}
{Student_ID, Student_Enroll, Student_Name}
{Student_ID, Student_Enroll, Student_Email}
{Student_ID, Student_Enroll, Student_Name, Student_Email}
The following would be the candidate key from the above −

{Student_ID}
{Student_Enroll}
{Student_Email}


Both Super Key and Candidate key are used to get records from tables. These keys are also used to 
create relationship between tables. Super Key and Candidate key both are used to identify records uniquely in a table. 
Both keys can have null values.

Following are the important differences between Super Key and Candidate key.

Sr. No.	Key	Super Key	Candidate key
1	Definition	Super Key is used to identify all the records in a relation.	
    Candidate key is a subset of Super Key.
2	Use	All super keys can't be candidate keys.	
    All candidate keys are super keys.
3	Super keys are combined together to create a candidate key.	
    Candidate keys are combined together to create a primary key.
4	Count Wise	Super keys are more than Candidate keys.	
    Candidate keys are less than Super Keys.
