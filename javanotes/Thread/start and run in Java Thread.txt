Difference between start and run in Java Thread
start vs run method in Java with ExampleSo what is difference between start and run method?
 Main difference is that when program calls start() method a new Thread is created and code inside run() method is executed in new Thread
 while if you call run() method directly no new Thread is created and code inside run() will execute on current Thread. 
Most of the time calling run() is bug or programming mistake because caller has intention of calling start() to create new thread and 
this error can be detect by many static code coverage tools like findbugs. If you want to perform time consuming task than always call
 start() method otherwise your main thread will stuck while performing time consuming task if you call run() method directly. 
Another difference between start vs run in Java thread is that you can not call start() method twice on thread object. 
once started, second call of start() will throw IllegalStateException in Java while you can call run() method twice.
