What happens when an Exception occurs in a thread?

In simple words, If not caught thread will die, if an uncaught exception handler is registered then it will get a call back. 
Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler is an interface, 
defined as nested interface for handlers invoked when a Thread abruptly terminates due to an uncaught exception. 
When a thread is about to terminate due to an uncaught exception the Java Virtual Machine will query the thread for its 
UncaughtExceptionHandler using Thread.getUncaughtExceptionHandler() and will invoke the handler's uncaughtException() method, 
passing the thread and the exception as arguments.
