Difference between HashSet and ArrayList in Java

1. Implementation : HashSet implements Set interface in Java while ArrayList  implements List interface.

2. Internal implementation: HashSet is backed by an HashMap while ArrayList is backed by an Array. 

3. Ordering : HashSet is an unordered collection and doesn't maintain any order while ArrayList maintains the order of the object in which they are inserted.

4. Duplicates : HashSet doesn't allow duplicates though ArrayList allows duplicate values.

5. Index based  :  The fifth difference between HashSet and ArrayList is that ArrayList is index based you can retrieve object by calling get(index) 
or remove objects by calling remove(index) while HashSet is completely object based.HashSet also doesn't provide get() method.

Example of HashSet and ArrayList in Java
import java.util.Hashtable;

public class HashSetArrayListExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
  
        ArrayList<String> arrlistobj = new ArrayList<String>();
        arrlistobj.add("1. Alive is awesome");
        arrlistobj.add("2. Love yourself");
        System.out.println("ArrayList object output :"+ arrlistobj);
 
        HashSet hashsetobj = new HashSet();
        hashsetobj.add("Alive is awesome");  
        hashsetobj.add("Love yourself"); 
        System.out.println("HashSet object output :"+hashsetobj);   
 }
}

Output
ArrayList object output :[1. Alive is awesome, 2. Love yourself]
HashSet object output :[Alive is awesome, Love yourself]

Similarities between HashSet and ArrayList 

1. Allows null : Both HashSet and ArrayList allows null.

2. Synchronized : Both HashSet and ArrayList are non synchronized collection class. One needs to avoid using them in multithreading environment.

3. Traversal : Both HashSet and ArrayList can be traversed through iterator in java.

4. Iterator : Both HashSet and ArrayList classes iterator are fail-fast i.e they will throw ConcurrentModificationException as soon as 
they detect any structural change in ArrayList or HashSet.
