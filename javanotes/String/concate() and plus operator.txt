Difference b/w concate() and + operator

POINTS	CONCAT() METHOD	+ OPERATOR
Definition	A concat() method is method to combine two strings .	
+ operator used to concatenate any number of strings.

Number of arguments	
In concat() method, takes only one argument of string and concatenate it with another string.	
In + operatortakes any number of arguments and combines all strings.

Type of arguments	
concat() method takes arguments of string type only.	
+ operator takes any type of argument and converts it to string type and then combine them.

Creates new string
concat() takes concatenates two strings and return new string object only string length is greater than 0, otherwise it returns same object..	
+ operatorcreates a new string object every time irrespective of length of string.

public class GFG { 
    public static void main(String[] args) 
    { 
  
        String s = "Geeks", g = ""; 
        String f = s.concat(g); 
        if (f == s) 
            System.out.println("Both are same"); 
        else
            System.out.println("not same"); 
        String e = s + g; 
        if (e == s) 
            System.out.println("Both are same"); 
        else
            System.out.println("not same"); 
    } 
} 
Output:
Both are same
not same

NullPointer Exception	
In concat() method raises NullPointer Exception when string is concatenated with null .	
+ operator concatenates string with without any error.

Performance
concat() method is better than + operator because it creates a new object only when the string length is greater than zero(0), so it uses less amount of memory.	
+ operator always a creates a new string irrespective of length of string therefore it takes more memory.
