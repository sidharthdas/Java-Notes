Microservices:

Why we need Microservices / drawbacks of monolithic architecture?
1. monolithic architecture application are large and complex in size.
2. It blocks quick development because of size of application
3. It blocks continuous development.
4. It is unscalable. We can't scale any single component, we have to create the instance for entire application.
5. Change in any  particular component needs to stop entire application.

Microservice: It is an architectural style that structures an application as an collection of small autonomous services, modelled around business domain.
In this architecture, each service is self contained and single business capability.

Features of Microservices:
1. small focused: 
2. Loosely coupled
3. Language neutral
