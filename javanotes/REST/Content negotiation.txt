Content negotiation
========================

This a feature in which suppose client wants the request in xml and 
the api is sending the response as json, so client is sending accept 
header as application/xml and there will no produces mentioned in the api, 
so by default it will json so just need to add jakson.dataformate dependency in pom file.

Note it you want to restrict at api end, u need to mentioned produces.

Accept - application/json ---- if client send this in header which mean browser 
								or client wanted response as json format.
								
								406 is returned by the server when it can't respond based 
								on accepting the request headers.
								
								
Content-type - application/json ---- if client send this in header which mean browser 
								or client sending request body as json format.
								
								415 is returned by the server when the entity sent in a request 
								(content in a POST or PUT) has an unsupported mediatype (i.e. they sent XML)
