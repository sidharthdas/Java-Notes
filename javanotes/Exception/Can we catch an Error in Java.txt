
Can we catch an Error in Java?
==================================
If you run following code then it will compile and run successfully,

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // insert code here
        try {
            new Example().go();
            // throw new OutOfMemoryError();
        } catch (Error e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }

    void go() {
        go();
    }
}

With following output :

java.lang.StackOverflowError

Answer:
------------

Yes, you can catch an Error, but you are advised not to do it, since Errors indicate 
serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch. (as stated in the Javadoc of Error)

since you have an error, it's a serious indication that you should never try to catch it.
Just don't do infinite things in your code, when this error happens, no stack space is available, how would you want to proceed?
StackOverFlowError indicates that you have severe problems, it's a bad idea to catch this error, 
instead, try to understand what problems you have in your code and fix them.
