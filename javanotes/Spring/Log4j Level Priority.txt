
Log4j Levels
-------------------------
Log4j provides many logging levels. Below is the complete list.

TRACE: The TRACE Level designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.
DEBUG: The DEBUG Level designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.
INFO: The INFO level designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.
WARN: The WARN level designates potentially harmful situations.
ERROR: The ERROR level designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.
FATAL: The FATAL level designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.
ALL: The ALL has the lowest possible rank and is intended to turn on all logging.
OFF: The OFF has the highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.
ALL and OFF are special logging levels and should be used in extreme situations. I have never used these personally at any point of time.

Log4j Level Order/Priority
---------------------------------
Trace is of the lowest priority and Fatal is having highest priority. Below is the log4j logging level order.

Trace < Debug < Info < Warn < Error < Fatal.


When we define logger level, anything having higher priority logs are also getting printed. For example, if 
logger level is INFO then debug logs will not be printed but Warn logs will be printed because of higher priority.
