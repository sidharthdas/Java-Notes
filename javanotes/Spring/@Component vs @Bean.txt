@Component vs @Bean
------------------------

@Component auto detects and configures the beans using classpath scanning whereas
@Bean explicitly declares a single bean, rather than letting Spring do it automatically.

@Component does not decouple the declaration of the bean from the class definition where as 
@Bean decouples the declaration of the bean from the class definition.

@Component is a class level annotation whereas 
@Bean is a method level annotation and name of the method serves as the bean name.

@Component need not to be used with the @Configuration annotation where as 
@Bean annotation has to be used within the class which is annotated with @Configuration.

We cannot create a bean of a class using @Component, if the class is outside spring container whereas we can create a bean of a class using 
@Bean even if the class is present outside the spring container.

@Component has different specializations like @Controller, @Repository and @Service whereas @Bean has no specializations
