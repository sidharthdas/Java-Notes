Q - what is difference between get and load.
Ans. when we use get() to retrieve data that doesn’t exists, it returns null. 
That makes sense because it try to load the data as soon as it’s called.
With load(), we are able to print the id but as soon as we try to access other fields, 
it fires database query and throws org.hibernate.ObjectNotFoundException if there is no record found with the given identifier.

	Manager table (mgrid[1, 2, 3], name[mark, sss, san])
	Employe Table (empid, empname, mgrid)
Q - Different types of join.	
Q. find manager who doesn't have emp assigned
Q - what is the query to find 10th highest salary from employee table?

 select name ,salary from employee e1 where 10-1 = (select count(distinct salary) from employee e2 where e2.salary > e1.salary);\
 Generallize query : select name ,salary from employee e1 where N-1 = (select count(distinct salary) from employee e2 where e2.salary > e1.salary);
                     Note : where n is number of Nth highest salary.

Q - Write an SQL query
  
Given below is the employee table with salary

EMPID    SALARY
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ 

101        10000
102        20000
103        1400
...
...
OUTPUT:

EMPID    RANK[Based on Salary]
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  _ _ 

102        1
101        2
103        3
...
...
[HINT] : RANK OF AN EMPLOYE CAN BE DETERMINED BY THE COUNT OF EMPLOYESS HAVING SALARY GREATER THAN EMPLOYEE
